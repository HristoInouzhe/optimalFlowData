# Introduction

*optimalFlowData* is a package containing 40 simulated flow cytometry datasets, saved as data frames, used for testing and developping examples for the package *optimalFlow* based on the results in @optimalFlow.

The simulated cytometries are based on data that come from flow cytometry measurements obtained following the Euroflow protocols and kindly provided by Centro de Investigaci√≥n del Cancer (CIC) in Salamanca, Spain. The artificial cytometries mimic 31 cytometries from healthy individuals and 9 cytometries from patients with different types of cancer.

# Installation

Installation procedure:

```{r ej0, eval = FALSE}
if (!requireNamespace("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE))
    install.packages("BiocManager")

BiocManager::install("optimalFlowData")
```

# Use
```{r ej01, eval = TRUE}
library(optimalFlowData)
head(Cytometry1)
```
We can create a database of gated cytometries containing. For simplicity and visualisation we only choose 4 cell types. For an example of a database, we select some of the cytometries, as is usual in machine learning, where a subset of the data is the learning set.
```{r ej1, eval = TRUE}
database <- buildDatabase(
  dataset_names = paste0('Cytometry', c(2:5, 7:9, 12:17, 19, 21)),
    population_ids = c('Monocytes', 'CD4+CD8-', 'Mature SIg Kappa', 'TCRgd-'))
```
A plot of the data in a 3 dimensional subspace
```{r ej2, echo = TRUE}
pairs(database[[1]][,c(4, 3, 9)], col = droplevels(database[[1]][, 11]))
```
The diagnosis for each cytometry is obtained as follows
```{r ej3, echo = TRUE}
help("cytometry.diagnosis") # for an explanation of the abbreviations
cytometry.diagnosis
```
